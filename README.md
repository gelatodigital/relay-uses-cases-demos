### Relay Unit Testing with Hardhat
This project demonstrates unit testing with Relay.
It comes with sample counter contracts and unit tests for each.
Fee payment in ETH (native), as well as ERC20 tokens, is demonstrated where applicable.&nbsp;

### Swap Fee Token
This project demonstrates synchronous fee payment (callWithSyncFee/callWithSyncFeeERC2771) using an unsupported fee token. Rather than using _transferRelayFee, it introduces _swapAndTransferRelayFee which swaps the unsupported token to a supported fee token using any Uniswap-based router and transfers it to the fee collector.&nbsp;

### Gasless Contract Deployment aka Gelato Deployer
This project demonstrates network-agnostic contract deployment using Relay and 1Balance by introducing the deploy-sdk. Contracts are deployed at the same precomputed address on every network using Create2. This eliminates the need for dedicated deployer wallets and native tokens on every network providing a seamless developer experience. &nbsp;
